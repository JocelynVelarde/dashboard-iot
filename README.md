# Secure Sense

## Installation

To install all of the dependencies, you'll need to first make a virtual environment like so :
```bash
py -m venv .venv
```
Next, you'll want to activate the venv like so:
```bash
.venv/Scripts/activate
```
Now navigate to the `backend` directory.
Then, you'll want to install all backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, please note that this is a project built on top of Streamlit, and so you'll need a `.streamlit` folder with a `secrets.toml` file with all of your streamlit api keys.
